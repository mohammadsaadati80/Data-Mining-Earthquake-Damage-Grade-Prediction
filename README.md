# Data Mining Earthquake Gorkha
Final Project, Data Mining Course, University of Tehran

In this project, we intend to turn the problem of estimating the damage caused to buildings by earthquakes based on their characteristics into a classification problem. 
Among the factors that can affect the amount of damage to a building in an earthquake can be the geographical area where the building is located, 
the number of floors of the building, the materials used in the building, the purpose of construction, the number of people And the families living in the building and the status of legal ownership of the land.
In this project, we encounter problems that may arise during the classification process (such as the large number of features, the Label Imbalance problem, etc.) and take action to solve them.

We used ```Support vector machines``` and ```Multi-layer Perceptron``` models to find the right model for learning.
Also we implemented Automated Feature Engineering using ```AutoFeat``` and using a ```Logistic Regression``` model and engineered features, we learned a new model and compared its performance with the previous model.
